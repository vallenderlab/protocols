## Leukocytes (Buffy Coat) Isolation Protocol {#leukocyte_isolation}

For this procedure we have used BD Pharm Lysis buffer.  The below protocol was given to us by a neighboring lab (ask if you need to know the source of this protocol):

1.	Collect blood in heparinized (green cap) or EDTA (Purple cap) coated tube. 
2.	Transfer 500 µl of the blood in a 50 mL conical tubes (> 500 µl). 
3.	Make 1x BD Pharm lyse buffer (from 10X stock). 
4.	Add 5 mL of 1x buffer .
5.	GENTLY vortex for 5 seconds. 
6.	Place in dark cabinet for 10 minutes.
7.	Centrifuge 200g 5 min.
8.	Discard the supernatant. 
9.	Gently re-suspend and wash the pellet with 1x PBS, 2% FBS and centrifuge at 350g for 5 min.
10.	Repeat wash step, until solution is mostly clear.  
11.	Re-suspend the pellet (cells) in a small volume (1 ml) of 1x PBS, 2% FBS, and then proceed with further cleaning or DNA isolation.

### Further Washing and Platelet Removal (Optional)

Washing the cell isolate

1. Estimate the volume of the transferred mononuclear cells. Add at least 3 volumes (~ 1.5 ml) of balanced salt solution (PBS) to the mononuclear cells in the centrifuge tube.
2. Suspend the cells by gently drawing them in and out of a pipette.
3. Centrifuge 1600rpm for 20 min at 18ºC to 20°C.
(**Note:** __A centrifugation at high speed increases the mononuclear cell recovery. However, if it is important to also get rid of platelets a lower centrifugation speed is recommended (60 to 100 × g).__)
4. Remove the supernatant.
5. Resuspend the mononuclear cells in 1.5 to 2 ml balanced salt solution.
6. Centrifuge 1600rpm for 20 min at 18ºC to 20°C.
7. Remove the supernatant.
8. Resuspend the cell pellet in media appropriate for the application.
9. Freeze immediately on dry ice.
10. Store at -80ºC.
