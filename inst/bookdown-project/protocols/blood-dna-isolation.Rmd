## DNA Isolation from Blood

Blood draws are an easy way for our lab to get genetic information from the non-human primates that are currently under study.  Ideally, these samples would be processed for DNA isolation immediately.  However, many of the blood samples that we have in our blood library are around 10 years old, and for some samples it can be difficult to generate high yielding, clean DNA samples.  While not all of our older blood samples are compromised, there were enough failed or low yielding samples over time among multiple technicians to justify troubleshooting the DNA isolation procedure.

In order to generate better results, existing protocols for isolating leukocyte (white blood cell) and for isolating DNA using buffy coat (white blood cells) have been modified.  Leukocytes are isolated with BD Pharm Lyse buffer, which are then used with the Gentra Puregene Blood Kit for DNA isolation.  While this could be done with other kits such as the Flexigene DNA Kit, the Gentra Puregene Blood Kit was chosen for its protein precipitation step.  Many kits use a protease such as Proteinase K to digest proteins, but Gentra Puregene uses a Protein Precipitation solution that seems to be more effective for our leukocyte samples and has a longer lasting shelf life.
