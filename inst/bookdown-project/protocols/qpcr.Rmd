## qPCR Protocol {#qpcr_protocol}

For our lab we use Roche’s Universal Proble Library (preferred) with the FastStart Master Mix protocol, and a SYBR Green protocol. This qPCR protocol is written for the UPL system.  We also use a LightCycler 96 thermocycler to measure the qPCR reaction.

### Materials

* Full range of pipettes and matching tips
* cDNA Samples
* Fast Start Master Mix
* UPL Primers and Probes
* RNase/DNase/Nuclease free water
* Ice bucket/ice
* Cold blocks, LightCycler plates, plate film
* Lab notebook and/or experiment sheets


### Experiment Preparation

1.  Clean and organize the workbench.
2.  Utilize a lab notebook for planning the experiment and taking notes during the experiment.
3.	Determine the number of cDNA samples, target genes, reference genes, and replicates (usually 2-3).
4.	Decide what type of controls that you will use.  Always include a negative control (water instead of cDNA), and a No Template Control (no water or cDNA).
5.	Design the plate layout with the LightCycler software (print out the plate design for the lab notebook or for reference).
6.	Using the experiment sheet determine the volume and concentration of the reagents needed for the master mix.  Keep for your records. 
7.	Remove all reagents from the fridge and allow to thaw on ice.  Place DNA/RNA free water on the table.  Reagents should be thawed slowly, so hand thaw for a short time at the beginning.
8.	Organize the reagents in the ice bucket, so they are easy to keep up with during the experiment.
9.	If you haven’t done so recently, then verify that your samples and primers are at the proper concentrations.
10.	Preheat the LightCycler lid.


### Wet Chemistry

1.	Mix thawed reagents by gently flicking with your fingers.  Afterwards spin down the reagents to prevent pipette contamination.  Keep reagents on ice.
2.	Create the master mixes for each reference gene and each target gene.  Keep them on ice at all times to avoid any unwanted chemical reactions.
3.  Plate the reaction solution - **Option 1 (Accuracy – For Publications)**:
    a.	Put the required volume of master mix into each well by reverse pipetting.  For this step utilize the same pipette tip or a repeater pipettor.
    b.	Using separate tips for each well, mix the cDNA by pipetting up and down.  Be sure to follow the plate design created with the LighCycler.
4.  Plate the reaction solution - **Option 2 (Timing – For Testing and Building qPCR skills)**:  
    a.	For each sample, take the total volume of master mix that will be used for all of the replicates and pipette it into one of the appropriate wells.  In the same well add the total volume of cDNA template necessary for all of the replicates.
    b.	Mix up and down with the pipette.
    c.	Distribute the appropriate volume of reaction solution to the desired number of replicate wells.
5.	During step 3 or 4, mark the plate and/or your lab notebook to keep up with what’s been plated and switch out the aluminum plate block when it’s no longer cold.
6.	Put the LightCycler film onto the plate.  Using a kim-wipe, rub the adhesive onto the plate so that each well is sealed properly.  This also polishes the film so that the LightCycler doesn’t pick up any unwanted signals.
7.	Briefly spin down the plate in order to collect any liquid on the sides of the wells, and to remove air bubbles.  Do not spin for more than 15 or 20 seconds.
8.	Select and Run the LighCycler program.
