# Preface

This manual was written by Rob Gilmore and Shaurita Hutchins for the purposes of showcasing the 
various ways the lab has implemented experimental procedures, as well as lab management tasks 
and administrative related duties for Dr. Eric Vallender's lab located in the Division of Neurobiology 
and Behavior Research, Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, University of Mississippi Medical Center,
Jackson, Mississippi.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# set seed for reproducible widget id
if (requireNamespace("htmltools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  htmlwidgets::setWidgetIdSeed(42)
}
library(leaflet)
jackson <- leaflet() %>% 
  setView(lng = -90.1730625, lat = 32.3308125, zoom = 11) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = -90.1730625, lat = 32.3308125, popup = "UMMC's Guyton Research Complex")

Many of the procedures in this manual were also taken from the protocol guide written by Lisa Ogowa in Dr.
Eric Vallener's lab while they were at the New England Primate Research Center, Harvard School of Medicine,
Boston, MA.
