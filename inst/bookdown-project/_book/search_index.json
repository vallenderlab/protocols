["things-to-consider.html", "3.1 Things to Consider", " 3.1 Things to Consider 3.1.1 Contamination When preforming any type of experiment, it’s always important to prevent cross contamination. For cell culture experiments, it’s bacterial or fungal cells, and for many molecular experiments it’s DNA or RNA contamination from other samples. Reagent contamination is another dangerous and often overlooked type of cross contamination that can affect current and future experiments. This is why it’s necessary to make working solutions of your stock reagents. It may seem like it takes a lot of time, but in the end working solutions save time and money that would otherwise be spent troubleshooting an experiment that is behaving abnormally. Having a pre-measured or pre-diluted working solution is the best way to prevent mathematical, pipetting, and contamination errors. Working solutions also help with the calculations that need to be made before an experiment takes place, which saves valuable time. If and when mistakes are made, contaminated reagents can easily be discarded and new working solutions can be retrieved from storage. (Always check the lab’s inventory before discarding a sample/reagent. Some samples and reagents have limited availability.) 3.1.2 Centrifugation When working through a protocol, gentle centrifugation of various tubes or plates is usually necessary. Air bubbles, liquid on the sides, or liquid on the top of your plates or tubes is not only annoying, but it also frequently leads to contamination, evaporation, improper volume, or improper concentration. These issues can be avoided by additionally checking to make sure your plates or tubes are sealed before centrifugation. If you end up contaminating some of your reagents, then clean your workspace thoroughly and dispose of anything that you suspect to be contaminated (check your inventory first). Proceed by creating more aliquots with the pseudo-stock solution or retrieving another working solution from storage. 3.1.3 Pipetting Pipetting is one of the very basic techniques that you will need to know for most labs. This lab in particular relies heavily on pipetting for molecular and cell culture experiments. So developing good pipetting skills is vital for success and efficiency. There are many special techniques that you can use in order to pipette like a seasoned professional. Gilson has a very comprehensive manual that I would suggest going over. It’s mentioned in this Bitesize Bio blog post on pipetting techniques. While preference often plays a huge role in what pipette tips are purchased, some specialized tips have use-cases that go beyond user preference. For instance, some pipettors can only be used with certain tips, and some tips can only be used with certain pipettors. Other special properties, such as being sterile (rnase, dnase, and protease free), or having filtered tips, also makes a difference when selecting pipette tips. Filtered tips are useful for preventing pipettor contamination. They are vital in certain situations such as DNA or RNA isolation and cell culture. In these situations it’s usually important to utilize filter tips that are also dnase/rnase/protease free. "],
["preparing-for-an-experiment.html", "3.2 Preparing for an Experiment", " 3.2 Preparing for an Experiment Always prepare your experiment ahead of time, whether it’s the night before or a few hours before you need to begin. 3.2.1 Reading Always read through the manufacturer’s and/or proprietary protocols that you will be using at least a day in advance, and then review the protocol before preparing your experiment. You may also want to read alternative instructions or online forums in order to see what other scientists are doing to solve the same problems. 3.2.2 Calculating Human error is also more frequently introduced, when attempting to quickly work out math problems. Before starting an experiment, always carefully work through any calculations. It’s never a good idea or feeling to begin doing math that takes 10 minutes in the middle of a time sensitive protocol that only allows for 5 minutes of extra time. Dilutions for example need to be done before the experiment so that you have an adequate amount of time and working solution for your protocol. 3.2.3 Pre-Cleaning Tidying up or organizing your workspace before and after an experiment helps keep things in order, which in turn helps you focus on your assay vs. finding the right pipettor underneath your stack of protocols. Clearing your workspace also gives you the opportunity to use 70% ethanol to clean the workbench and the equipment. This step is important to remove any unwanted debris, whether it be tissue, DNA, RNA, skin cells (your own or someone else’s), chemicals, and bacteria. Cleaning in this manner also makes the lab bench a safe place for everyone’s experiments, lab notebooks, and personal safety. "],
["during-the-experiment.html", "3.3 During the Experiment", " 3.3 During the Experiment 3.3.1 Testing If it’s the first time your are running an experiment it’s always a good idea to do a test run. For most cases there should be some extra sample materials that you can use in order to test your abilities. This is especially important if you are low on sample material for your real experiment! Ask someone in the lab if they know where to find extra samples or reagents. 3.3.2 Timing Timing is always important. Whether you are doing an experiment for the first time or you are trying to optimize an experiment, it’s a wise idea to time yourself. Knowing the time will help you plan experiments in the future. Cell culture and animal model experiments take days/weeks/months of time to execute so careful planning is needed in order to optimize the time of everyone involved. The same is needed for molecular experiments, but usually only on an hourly/daily/weekly time schedule. 3.3.3 Writing It’s always important to take notes during a protocol. Some labs are very strict about lab notebooks, and how they are kept. This lab is not as strict, but we still find it very important to keep an informal lab notebook for each type of experiment. In some instances we have simply kept a record using a notepad. 3.3.4 Post-Cleaning Tidying up or organizing your workspace before and after an experiment helps keep things in order, which in turn helps you focus on your assay vs. finding the right pipettor underneath your stack of protocols.

["sample-collection.html", "4 Sample Collection", " 4 Sample Collection Sample collection is an important first step for the design of any molecular experiment. The samples that we collect in our lab usually come from rhesus, humans, rats, or mice. The samples are usually tissue like brain, liver, skin, blood, or heart, but hey can also be other biological material such as saliva or feces. Different tissue types will be used for different downstream applications and require different protocols for pre and post processing of the tissue samples. Another thing to consider when recieving tissue samples is the time. How long has the tissue been exposed to the elements? How long in between the organism’s death (if dead) and tissue collection? How long in between the tissue collection and storage? The animals we use are usually lab animals, and so the tissue samples usually come from living animals or recently decesead animals. So most of this is usually well controlled. However, if the animal tissue has been collected from a deceased animal, then the time of death is still important to the sample integrity. The moment an organism dies is the moment the degradation process begins. Common sample types: Rhesus/Rat/Human Brain (fatty) Rhesus Blood; Leukocytes Rat Liver Rhesus Feces Human/Rhesus Saliva Cells (from cell culture) Rhesus Skin Biopsy Common downstream sample use cases: iPSC generation scRNAseq/FACS 16s rRNA (microbiome sequencing) DNA isolation and genotyping RNA isolation and phenotyping Validation "],
["dna-isolation-samples.html", "4.1 DNA Isolation Samples", " 4.1 DNA Isolation Samples Generally speaking, most tissue that we deal with including brain, blood, heart, liver, and even cell culture samples can be processed for DNA isolation. While different tissues will have their own processing protocols, they all need some of the same basic storage conditions. The two primary concerns for tissue being collected for DNA isolation is keeping them cold and keeping them dry. For samples that are being actively used, storage at 4°C is better to prevent damage from freeze thaw cycles. Otherwise, samples can be kept at -20°C in a normal freezer, -80°C in an ultra freezer or -180°C in liquid nitrogen. While dehydrating the tissue samples with liquid nitrogen can be beneficial for long term sample storage, tissue is usually stored in a container with or without a solution such as Ethanol or DMSO. Blood is a special case, because it can clot and cause issues. Generally, blood is drawn by a special technician and immediately stored in Heparin or EDTA coated tubes to prevent clotting. genotyping rheuse/rat/human brain, blood/leukocytes, liver, saliva, cell culture, heart, etc Genotyping Cell culture validation Sanger Sequencing "],

["rna-isolation-samples.html", "4.3 RNA Isolation Samples", " 4.3 RNA Isolation Samples The tissue used for DNA isolation can also be used for RNA isolation except for blood which contains little to no RNA. However, the methods in which tissue is processed for RNA isolation is very important. Since RNA is single stranded and intra/extra-cellular it is much more volatile than DNA, which is fairly stable after isolation at room temperature. phenotyping Rhesus/Rat/Human Brain (fatty) NGS/RNAseq Gene expression/differentiation qPCR scRNAseq/FACS Sample condition is very important to RNA integrity. When collecting tissue samples for RNA isolation it’s best to start the isolation procedure as soon as possible or to alternatively process the samples with RNAlater products. While RNA degrades quickly (especially in the presence of RNase), different strands of RNA have varying degradation rates. So as the gap of time increases in between speciment death, tissue collection, rna isolation, and rna quantification the more unpredictable and inaccurate the RNA becomes. 4.3.1 Tissue Preservation with RNALater Below are descriptions of serveral RNAlater brand products. They help with tissue processing and storing pre-isolation. RNA Stabilization Solution is an aqueous tissue storage reagent that rapidly permeates most tissues to stabilize and protect RNA in fresh specimens. It eliminates the need to immediately process or freeze samples; the specimen can simply be submerged in RNAlater® Solution and stored for analysis at a later date. RNAlater®-ICE is a novel reagent for transitioning frozen tissue to a state that can be readily processed by common homogenization methodologies to extract high quality RNA. It circumvents the need to grind frozen tissue into a powder before homogenization, and even makes it possible to further dissect tissues before homogenization without RNA loss or degradation. "],

To actually start a PCR experiment, several things need to take place: DNA has to be isolated and verified from the target organisms. Primers have to be designed, ordered, resuspended, and diluted to the proper concentrations. The experiment has to be designed, and the workspace has been prepared. A program has to be created on the thermocycler, and the QiAxcel has been prepared for a gel read. 6.1.1 Primers Primers are the cornerstone of any PCR. Many vendors sell primers that already work with a particular gene. However, many scientists have to design their own primers, because the gene of interest is not available from a commercial distributor. After the primers have been obtained, they need to be resuspended in DNAse free molecular grade water. This is called the “stock solution”. A “working solution(s)” should also be made to preserve the stock solution. "],

The end goal of electrophoresis is to effectively estimate the number of base pairs in the DNA samples that are being tested in order to identify the alleles that are present. Generally, we use the QIAxcel for capillary electrophoresis, which is much faster than gel electrophoresis.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) or Real Time PCR (rtPCR) is an older technique that has been largely replaced with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) also known as High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) for some applications. Nevertheless, qPCR is still widely used for a multitude of experimental procedures including validation of NGS/HTS results. qPCR machines work the same as traditional thermocyclers, except they contain photodetectors for measuring fluorescent signals.

["dilutions.html", "8.1 Dilutions", " 8.1 Dilutions Please memorize the CiVi = CfVf formula for making dilutions. It is used in many of the experiments that we do in this lab. The core concept and formula is M = CV (Mass = Concentration * Volume). In a dilution the mass of the solute does not change (e.g. Mi = Mf). It’s very important that you do this math ahead of time after you’ve designed your experiment. Make sure that you have enough of your solution at each stage of your dilution. For example, if you are diluting your primers for a PCR and you only have 125 ul of 200 uM, then there is a maximum amount of 100 uM solution that you will be able to make: Ci = 200 uM, Vi = 125 ul, Cf = 100 uM, Vf = The maximum amount of 100 uM solution that we can make. Vf = (200 uM) * (125 uL) / 100 uM = 600 uL So the maximum amount of 100 uM solution that we will be able to make is 600 uL. 8.1.1 Stock vs Psuedo-stock vs Working Solutions It’s wise to create stock and working solutions in order preserve your reagents and to prevent contamination. The stock solution is the solution of the largest volume and/or concentration. Generally, the stock solution is kept in the manufacturer’s container for easy identification and to prevent contamination. A working solution is an aliquot of the stock solution that is used in an experiment. In some situations it might be a good idea to make a psuedo-stock solution (at half the concentration of the stock) before a working solution is made. This is an extra step that not only prevents frequent freeze thaw cycles of your stock solution, but it also lowers the number of times that you have to pipette into and out of the stock solution.

Knowing how to handle collected tissue and downstream products is an important means to getting high quality RNA yields that accurately reflect in vivo RNA levels. 8.4.1 RNase Free RNase is an enzyme that degrades RNA strands. These molecules can be found in the body, on your skin, on the lab bench, and in the air. RNase is also very hard to neutralize (RNase A variant), especially when compared to DNase. Because of this it is essential to use RNase free techniques when preforming any task in the RNA isolation procedure. Many vendors supply DNase, RNase, Nuclease, and Protease free tips, water, tubes, etc. which are also sterile.

["design-primers.html", "8.5 Designing Primers", " 8.5 Designing Primers Designing primers is a good way to get familiar with DNA as a sequence. It will also help you understand some of the chemistry that’s involved with a PCR reaction. There are plenty of guides out there, but this one is one of our favorites. In order to design a primer you must first have a DNA sequence of interest. This can be accomplished in several ways. 99% of the time you have a target gene of interest. So if you can find the NCBI accession number or GI number (deprecated for future annotations), then you can get your sequence of interest. Some common tools to fascilitate this process include Primer3Plus, NCBI’s PrimerBlast, UCSC’s Blat, and UCSC’s In-Silico PCR. UCSC and NCBI also have a wide array of useful tools that are worth exploring. 8.5.1 Ordering Primers Once the primers have been designed, verify them with someone else in the lab and then consult Dr. Vallender. Generally, he will order the primers himself from Integrated DNA Technologies. IDT is another great resource for learning more about molecular biology. 8.5.2 Stock Solution (Note: Please read this section along with the Molecular Best Practices section and dilution section if you’ve never resuspended a primer before.) The lyophilized (dried) primers are ususally delivered in a cardboard envelope. IDT has this to say about lypholized/dry oligos compared to resuspended oligos: Oligos that are resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA; such as IDTE), are more stable than dry oligos at room temperature or 4°C. Oligos that are stored in water are the least stable. However, at 4°C, oligos stored under all of these conditions are stable for at least 60 weeks. For long term storage, whether oligos are dried down, or resuspended in non-DEPC treated water or TE buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA; such as IDTE), it’s optimal to store them frozen, at -20°C. Also, it is ideal to store oligos in the dark. Exposure to UV light should be avoided, and ambient lab light should be minimized, particularly for some types of modified oligos. Please see the Technical Report, Oligonucleotide Stability Study, for data on oligonucleotide storage and a more thorough explanation. Before resuspending the primers you should note a few things: The stock solution is the most concentrated form of your primer so be careful with it. Careful not to contaminate the stock tube. Always spin down the lypholized primer, before opening the tube. Always spin down the resupended primer. Always use a new tip. Don’t contaminate the stock tube. (Do you see what I did there?) Resuspend primer stock solutions to 100uM or 200uM, create pseudo-working solutions if applicable, create working solutions, and then freeze them all down. For a 200 uM stock solution: Dissolve fresh primer with the 5X volume of water as its concentration to get a 200 uM concentration. For example, for 25 nmoles (nanomoles) of primer, add 125 ul of water. This will give you a concentration of 0.0002 M or 0.2 mM or 200 uM. (25 nmoles/L) (x moles/125 * 10-6 L) = .0002 mole/L = 0.0002 M = 0.2 mM = 200 uM For a 100 uM stock or psuedo-working solution: Dissolve fresh primer with the 10X volume of water as its concentration to get a 100 uM concentration. For example, for 25 nmoles (nanomoles) of primer, add 250 ul of water. This will give you a concentration of 0.0001 M or 0.1 mM or 100 uM. (25 nmoles/L) (x moles/250 * 10-6 L) = .0001 mole/L = 0.0001 M = 0.1 mM = 100 uM (Note: If this is confusing to you, then try using the primer resuspension calculator by IDT.) If it’s available use TE buffer to store the stock solutions. For most cases use no more than 1/3 of the volume of your stock tubes to create the first working solution. 8.5.3 Working Solution Working solutions are exactly what they sound like. The solutions that you will be using during an experiment. Generally, the working solution will be at 10uM, but they can be adjusted for various resons or in special protocols. When making working solutions it’s important not to contaminate the stock tube. If you want to get fancy, then you can make several dilution steps for your primers to reduce freeze/thawing of the stock solution (e.g. 200uM stock, 100uM psuedo-working, and 10uM working). "],

In this case you would create a [master mix] (link to mastermix form) using the reagents mentioned above. (Note: The GoTaq Master Mix is a reagent and should not be confused with the PCR master mix, which is simply a mixture of the mentioned reagents.), which contains the GoTaq master mix.) The volume of each reagent is the number of samples multiplied by the reaction volume of that reagent for one sample/well. These volumes are increased by 10% in order to adjust for pipetting errors. See the figure below for details: The master mix is then distributed among the reaction wells, which is followed by the addition of DNA. After the PCR reactions have been created, the thermocycler needs to be set up. 8.6.2 Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis (Optional) After PCR, a restriction enzyme can be used to digest DNA at restriction enzyme sites for targeted genes. Samples with varying sites will have differing restriction fragment lengths, which can be exploited in order to identify allelic differences. 8.6.3 Thermocycler The thermocycler is a machine that “thermo” “cycles”. The machine can be programmed to cycle through the necessary temperatures required to amplifiy DNA using the PCR reaction described previously. Not all primers/DNA/reagent combinations work with the same thermocycle program, but generally the following program is a good place to start: "],

If the channels are injected with air bubbles they will have to be Purged (a 90 minute process), and they could be rendered permanently broken. Remove all air bubbles from the PCR tubes/plate by briefly spinning down the samples. Place the PCR tubes or 96 well plate on the QIAXcel cart. Make sure each column has the same number of samples. If a row is empty, then replace it with water to prevent air bubble formation in the channels. Close the hatch and open the BioCalculator Software. The shortcut can be found in the QIAxcel folder on the deskop. Open the Instrument Control panel in order to connect to the QIAxcel. Check the Status Panel to make sure there are no red indicators. Use the AM420 Method for each row (A through H). which is determined by the Pos tab. Create a unique Sample name for each row. Your files will be named using this parameter. (Optional) Click the Sample Info box to create a table for your PCR sample arrangement. Leave Time blank, but for each row being used the Runs section must be equal to “1”. Check the Inc box for all rows being used, except for the last row. Under Chan:, check the boxes that correspond to the columns being used in the experiment. Choose a fun sound file to indicate when the electrophoresis run has finished. Choose a Local Data Directory (Defaults to C:/Documents and Settings/QIAxcel/Desktop/QIAxcel/Data) Choose a User ID for yourself that you will always use for your experiments. a. If you have a UMMC username, then that would suffice. Choose a Plate ID that describes the gel run. a. A good practice is to include the date (YYYY-MM-DD) along with the gene(s) or experiment(s) or project(s) name. b. Examples: “2015-07-29_DRD4_DMSO” or “2018-06-21_scRNAseq_Luc2” Check the following boxes: a. Automatically analyze after data acquisition b. Autoscale time axis during acquisition c. Include reference marker table. Click the Marker button and make sure your markers are correct. Run the experiment. 8.7.1 Organizing Data (Note: This mostly applies for the primary user account named QIAxcel. Since this account is being shared by multiple people, this short guide should help keep things organized. Information about QIAxcel data output can be found on page 5-10 and 5-20 of the User Manual.) In order to better keep up with data produced by the QIAxcel you can utilize the features that come with the BioCalculator software. By default the Data Directory is set to C:/Documents and Settings/QIAxcel/Desktop/QIAxcel/Data, which is a shortcut to QIAxcels installation directory. This can be changed if needed, however, it’s recommended to use this folder to keep the desktop clean and organized. In the Instrument Control panel you can use the User ID and Plate ID to direct the output of the QIAxcel after it finishes running your gel. The User ID is used as a subfolder in the Data Directory. The Plate ID is used as a subfolder in the User ID directory. Please try to use the same User ID if you can. Folders have been created based on UMMC usernames for your convenience. This setup is not meant to pidgeon-hole you into organizing your data in this fashion, but to simply provide some guidelines to keep the public file system less confusing. If you desire, then a profile can be made for you on the laptop so that you can manage your data in your own folders. Please don’t lock your profile with a password. Please make sure to log off of your personal profile when you finish. Only one instance of the BioCalculator software can be open, so please close it on your profile when you’re done. If you need to access data produced before June 21, 2018, it can be found in the C:/Documents and Settings/QIAxcel/Desktop/QIAxcel/Data/2018-06-21_Archive folder. The folders below have been created based on UMMC usernames, so you can use those if you’d like. They are in the C:/Documents and Settings/QIAxcel/Desktop/QIAxcel/Data root directory. rgilmore evallender shutchins2 xzhang3 cmyers3 mcbaily 8.7.2 Syncing Data For the computer used to operate the QIAxcel there is a designated USB drive that has the name PCR_Station. Please return this USB drive to the computer after you finish offloading your data. And remember not to encrypt it on UMMC machines. Inside of the C:/Documents and Settings/QIAxcel/Desktop/QIAxcel/ folder there is a file called SYNC Data to USB. This is a batch file. If you double click it, the files in C:/Documents and Settings/QIAxcel/Desktop/QIAxcel/Data/ will begin to copy themselves over to the USB drive as long as it’s the E:/ Volume. Based on the command it will only copy file/folders that are are new or have been updated. "],
["qpcr-protocol.html", "8.8 qPCR Protocol", " 8.8 qPCR Protocol 8.8.1 Materials Full range of pipettes and matching tips Samples and reagents (master mix, target/housekeeping primers, etc). Ice bucket/ice Cold blocks, LightCycler plates, plate film Lab notebook and/or experiment sheet 8.8.2 Experiment Preparation Remove all reagents from the fridge and allow to thaw on ice. Place DNA/RNA free water on the table. Optimally, reagents are meant to be thawed slowly, so hand thaw for a short time at the beginning. Organize the reagents in the ice bucket in a way that makes sense for you and that is ergonomic for your workflow. Make sure you have all of your materials, that your workbench is clean, and that your workbench is organized the way you want it. If you haven’t done so recently, then verify that your samples and primers at the proper concentrations. While reagents are thawing, plan the experiment: Determine # of samples. Determine # of genes (target and reference; 1 of each for larger experiments). Determine # of replicates (usually 2-3). Determine controls. Positive control? Negative control (Always) Water instead of cDNA No Template Control (Always) No water or cDNA Design layout with the LightCycler software (print out the plate design for the lab notebook or for reference). Put aluminum plate blocks on ice. MATH: Using the experiment sheet determine how much of the reagents need to be used in the master mix, and to keep for your records. Compute 10% extra for each reagent’s volume, to account for pipetting errors. Preheat the LightCycler lid. 8.8.3 Wet Chemistry Utilize a lab notebook for planning experiment and taking notes during the experiment. Mix thawed reagents by gently flicking with your fingers. Afterwards spin down the reagents to prevent pipette contamination. Keep reagents on ice. Create the master mixes. One for each reference gene One for each target gene Keep master mixes on ice at all times to avoid any unwanted chemical reactions. Make sure to eject tips after measuring each reagent. Never use a tip with your stock solutions that have already touched another reagent. When in doubt, eject your tip beforehand. Plate the reaction solution. Option 1 (Accuracy – For Publications): Put the required volume of master mix into each well by reverse pipetting. For this step you can utilize the same pipette tip. You can also use a repeater pipette if the desired volume will work with the repeater pipette. Using separate tips for each well, add the cDNA in the order you’ve set up with the LightCycler software. Pipette the liquid in each well up and down to make sure the cDNA is mixed in each well. Option 2 (Timing – For Testing and Building qPCR skills): For speed you can add all of the master mix volume and all of the replicates volume into one well. Mix up and down with the pipette. Distribute the appropriate volume of reaction solution to the desired number of replicate wells. Mark the plate and/or your lab notebook to keep up with what’s been plated. Switch out the aluminum plate block when it’s no longer cold. Don’t forget the controls. After plating is finished put the film onto the plate. Using a kim-wipe, rub the adhesive onto the plate so that each well is sealed properly. This also polishes the film so that the LightCycler doesn’t pick up any weird signals. Select and Run the Lighcycler program. 8.8.4 LightCycler 96 Setup "],

["quartzy.html", "9.2 Quartzy for Inventory and Orders", " 9.2 Quartzy for Inventory and Orders Many of the items that we regularly order can be found on the Vallender Lab Quartzy website. If you would like to order something and need access to Quartzy, then please ask someone in the lab for an invitation. Quartzy uses a convenient import/export template model that allows you to bulk upload/download your entire inventory or requests using an Excel spreadsheet. Please consult someone in the lab who knows how to use these templates before you try to use them yourself. Quartzy also has plenty of guides you can use to understand their inventory system. 9.2.1 Managing Inventory Whether it be blood, DNA, RNA, cDNA, or tissue samples, equipment, primers, plasmids, chemicals, consumables, or other lab items, they can all be stored in the Quartzy Inventory for future reference or for purchasing. Additionally, Quartzy will compile a monthly email that contains an Inventory spreadsheet to give you updated information about what’s in the lab. Please consult someone in the lab in order to get your samples or items imported into Quartzy. 9.2.2 Requesting Items When you are ready to purchase an item, you can request them. When making a request, first check the Vallender Lab Inventory and then the Quartzy Shop. If your item cannot be found, then you will have to add an item to the inventory and then request it. Please make sure to add as much accurate information as possible when creating new inventory items. After making a request Dr. Vallender will receive an automated email from Quartzy so that he can approve the request. Following approval a requisition form can be made, and emailed directly to our Administrative Support Coordinator who will create a UMMC Purchase Order for the items. If the item you are looking for is not on the Quartzy account, please find the item and ask for someone else to add it to the Vallender Lab inventory manually. By doing this we can keep our inventory up to date and make future orders much easier to deal with. Additionally, you can find some of the approved vendors in the appendix. 9.2.3 Adding Freezer Boxes to Quartzy Inventory The majority of our Blood, DNA, Primers, etc. libraries are all in long term (-80) and short term (-20) freezer boxes. By using Quartzy’s import template to denote the box position, you can easily build on a printable inventory sheet for these libraries. Using this functionality will help everyone locate and keep up with various inventoried items. All of the current available boxes should be in the Lab Management folder under the Vallender Lab profile. If a new box is added to Quartzy, then please add the printable layout here. This particular functionality is useful, but takes some getting used to. To keep an accurate inventory, please ask someone for help when updating or adding a freezer box to quartzy. "],
