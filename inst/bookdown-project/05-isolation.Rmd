# Molecular: Isolation

Isolating various compounds is very important in a genetics lab.  There are many different techniques that
can be used to isolate various biological material, but we will only be covering the most common
techniques used in our lab:

* [Leukocyte Isolation](#leukocyte_isolation) from blood
* [DNA Isolation](#dna_isolation)
* [RNA Isolation](#rna_isolation)

## Leukocytes (Buffy Coat) Isolation

Leukocytes, more commonly known as white blood cells, are a type of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), which means that unlike red blood cells PBMCs have a nucleus.  While they make up less than 1% of the blood by volume, they will yield the majority of the DNA contained in blood samples:

```{r  out.width = "85%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("PCR-docs/blood_seperation.png") 
```

It its therefore advised to isolate the leukocytes before proceeding with DNA isolation for better results.  Many protocols already incorporate this step, but for some circumstances it may be useful to process the entire blood sample this way before proceeding.

## Isolating DNA

Many of our DNA isolation kits come from Qiagen, which has a very comprehensive methods article on their [website](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/molecular-biology-methods/dna/) about DNA.  Wikipedia also has a much simpler breakdown of what the [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction) looks like.  It's important to note that DNA isolation protocols differ based on the sample being used (brain, liver, blood, buffy coat, etc.), and are normally followed by some type of [genotyping](#molecular_genotyping) experiment.

## Isolating RNA

Qiagen also has a methods article for [RNA](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/molecular-biology-methods/rna/) on their website.  RNA is most often used to determine the expression level of protein coding genes.  For studies that involve animals with varying treatment conditions (placebo vs drug1), we might want to do differential expression (DE) analysis.  DE analysis can be accomplished with the following techniques used in our lab:

* [qPCR](#qpcr_protocol)
* RNAseq - NGS/HTS

RNA isolation (similar to DNA isolation) also depends on the sample type.  RNA is also __MUCH__ more sensitive to degradation, so extra care has to be taken in order to preserve the RNA for downstream analysis.
