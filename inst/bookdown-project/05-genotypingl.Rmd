# Molecular: Genotyping {#molecular_genotyping}

Genotyping is useful when we would like to compare the genetics of multiple animals.  Some of the genotyping methods that we use in our lab include:

* [Designing Primers](#design_primers)
* [PCR](#pcr_protocol)
* RFLP - Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism
* DNA sequencing

## Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

Watch this [cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KoLnIwoZKU) of PCR to get a better understanding of the process.  To actually start a PCR experiment, several things need to take place:

1. [DNA has to be isolated](#dna_isolation) and verified from the target organisms.
2. Primers have to be designed, ordered, resuspended, and diluted to the proper concentrations.
3. The experiment has to be [designed, and the workspace has been prepared](#noteworthy_techniques).
4. A program has to be created on the [thermocycler](#thermocycler), and the QiAxcel has been prepared for a gel read.

### Primers

Primers are the cornerstone of any PCR.  Many [vendors sell primers](#quartzy) that already work with a particular gene.  However, many scientists have to design their own primers, because the gene of interest is not available from a commercial distributor.  After the primers have been obtained, they need to be resuspended in DNAse free molecular grade water.  This is called the "stock solution".  A "working solution(s)" should also be made to preserve the stock solution.

## Electrophoresis

Generally, we use the QIAxcel for capillary electrophoresis, which is much faster than gel electrophoresis.  However, we also have the reagents and equipment to run a classic gel using ethidium bromide.
